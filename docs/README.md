# RetroVue playout engine documentation

This directory mirrors the RetroVue core documentation structure for infrastructure topics that apply to the native playout engine.

- `architecture/` holds system-level descriptions of how the playout engine fits into RetroVue.
- `runtime/` captures the operational model, threading, and timing contracts enforced at runtime.
- `infra/` documents integration details for deployment, monitoring, and Host OS dependencies.
- `developer/` provides build, testing, and troubleshooting guidance for engine contributors.
